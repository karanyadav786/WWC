Precision Farming with Drones üöú‚úàÔ∏è
Overview
Precision Farming with Drones leverages drone technology, GPS, and data analytics to revolutionize agriculture. This system provides real-time insights into crop health, optimizing planting, and improving yield predictions, enabling cost-efficient and sustainable farming practices.

Features
Crop Health Monitoring: Early detection of crop stress and diseases.
Precision Planting: Optimize planting patterns for maximum yield.
Yield Prediction: Accurate forecasting of crop yields.
Targeted Pesticide Use: Minimize pesticide usage through targeted applications.
Cost Efficiency: Reduce operational costs by optimizing farming techniques.
Objectives
The project aims to:

Enhance decision-making with real-time drone data.
Improve agricultural productivity and sustainability.
Reduce environmental impact by minimizing chemical use.
Technology Stack
Hardware
